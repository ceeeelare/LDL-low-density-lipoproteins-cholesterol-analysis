# INTRODUCTION

LDL (low-density lipoproteins) is a type of cholesterol that is 
known to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 
The study objective was to investigate the effect of  diet and fastfood 
consumption on LDL blood levels, in consideration of age and gender factors.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# First set your working directory
setwd("/Users/totomino/Google Drive/The wooden box/Statistics & Data Science/Linear+Model/Project+Assignment")
# read the data
load("LDL.RData")
str(LDL)
```

# I. RESULT (for other statisticians)

There are a total of forty subjects in the data. Twenty subjects that reported regular 
fastfood comsumption were selected, as well as 20 subjects that reported to only 
rarely eat fastfood. All subjects gave their consent for the use of their data in this study. 
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in LDL blood levels between 'often' and 
'rarely' in the fastfood consumption group. All hypothesis tests were performed at the 5\% level 
of significance. Confidence intervals were reported at the 95\% confidence level.

# DATA EXPLORATION

```{r}
# OVERVIEW OF THE DATA
# check to see if any missing data: is.na(LDL)
head(LDL)
summary(LDL)
glimpse(LDL)
```

Even though it seems an increased number of men consume fast-food more often than women, 
the Chi-squared test was performed with a p-value of 0.05653, which suggests no 
association between gender and fast-food consumption (the diet is independent of gender).

```{r}
# CATEGORICAL VARIABLES
# GENDER AND FASTFOOD CONSUMPTION
table1 <- table(LDL$gender,LDL$fastfood)
table1
# chi-squared test for independence of factors
summary(table1)
```

Even though it seems an increased number of men consume fast-food more often than women, 
the Chi-squared test was performed with a p-value of 0.05653, which suggests no association 
between gender and fast-food consumption (the diet is independent of gender).

```{r}
# NUMERICAL VARIABLES
summary(LDL$LDL)
summary(LDL$age)
# The average LDL grouped by gender and fast-food consumption
tapply(LDL$LDL,LDL$fastfood,summary)
tapply(LDL$LDL,LDL$gender,summary)
```

```{r}
# t-test to compare LDL blood levels in male and female
t.test(LDL$LDL ~ LDL$gender)
# t-test to compare LDL blood levels in rarely and often fastfood consumption
t.test(LDL$LDL ~ LDL$fastfood)
```

For the LDL blood levels, there is no significant different between male and female, 
neither between the rarely fastfood consumption and the often fastfood consumption (p=0.4418 and 0.4155, respectively).

# INITIAL VISUALIZATION OF DATA

```{r}
#Boxplot of age and LDL 
ggplot(LDL, aes(LDL, age, color = fastfood)) + geom_boxplot()

#Boxplot of LDL and gender
ggplot(LDL, aes(LDL, gender)) + geom_boxplot(color = "red")

#Boxplot of age and gender
ggplot(LDL, aes(age, gender)) + geom_boxplot(color = "dark green")

#Boxplot of LDL and fastfood 
ggplot(LDL, aes(LDL, fastfood)) + geom_boxplot(color = 'blue')

#Boxplot of age and LDL coloured for fastfood
ggplot(LDL, aes(LDL, age, color = fastfood)) + geom_boxplot()

#Boxplot of age and fastfood coloured for gender
ggplot(LDL, aes(age, fastfood, color = gender)) + geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
# boxplot and scatter plot of LDL & age with two different gender shown
# ggplot(LDL, aes(fastfood, LDL, color = gender)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(LDL, aes(age, LDL, color = gender)) + geom_point()
# boxplot and scatter plot of LDL & age with two different fastfood consumption shown
# ggplot(LDL, aes(age, LDL, color = fastfood)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(LDL, aes(age, LDL, color = fastfood)) + geom_point()
```

From the above plots, notice how the age affects LDL. Even those who often 
eat fast-food at young age have lower LDL than old people rarely eat fast-food.

```{r}
# CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE & LDL
cor(LDL$age,LDL$LDL)
# ggplot(LDL, aes(age, LDL)) + geom_point()
# interactive scatter plot of LDL & age with two different fastfood consumption shown
scatter.age.diet <- ggplot(LDL, aes(age, LDL, color = fastfood)) + geom_point()
# ggplotly(scatter.age.diet)
# interactive scatter plot of LDL & age with two different fastfood consumption shown
scatter.age.gend <- ggplot(LDL, aes(age, LDL, color = gender)) + geom_point()
# ggplotly(scatter.age.gend)
```

# LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS

Fit the first linear model for LDL and fastfood comsumption. As the 
regressor (fastfood consumption) is a categorical variable, we created a dummy 
variable for the two fastfood categories ('Often' and 'Rarely').

```{r}
# PREPARE DATA FOR REGRESSIONS
# dummify the fastfood categories
# fastfood often group = 0; fastfood rarely group = 1
# gender man = 0 ; gender woman = 1
LDL_survey <- dummy.data.frame(LDL)
dist_survey <- dist(LDL_survey,method='binary')
# glimpse(dist_survey)
# glimpse(LDL)
```

```{r}
# MODEL 1 TO FIT IN REGRESSIONS: LDL ~ diet
fastfood.model <- lm(LDL ~ fastfoodrarely + fastfoodoften, data = LDL_survey)
# we found that beta0 = 123.855, Beta1 = 3.220
summary(fastfood.model)
# t-value is 0.823 and pvalue = 0.415. verified below
t.obs.fastfood.model <- 3.220 / 3.911
t.obs.fastfood.model #0.8233188
#2 tails p-value
2*(1-pt(abs(t.obs.fastfood.model), df = 38))
#calculate the CI of fastfood.model
confint(fastfood.model)
```

Fit the second linear model for LDL and age:

```{r}
# MODEL 2 TO FIT IN REGRESSION: LDL ~ age
age_LDL.model <- lm(LDL ~ age, data = LDL_survey)
# we found that beta 0 = 90.0200, beta1 = 0.6248
summary(age_LDL.model)
# t-value is
t.obs.age_LDL.model <- 0.48261 / 0.09914
# 2 tails p-value
2*(1-pt(abs(t.obs.age_LDL.model), df = 37))
# calculate the CI
confint(age_LDL.model)
```

```{r}
# MODEL 3 TO FIT IN REGRESSIONS: LDL ~ gender
gender.model <- lm(LDL ~ genderwoman + genderman, data = LDL_survey)
# we found that beta0 = 123.855, Beta1 = 3.220
summary(gender.model)
# t-value is -0.781 and pvalue = 0.44. verified below
t.obs.gender.model <- -3.072 / 3.934
t.obs.gender.model #-0.7808846
#2 tails p-value
2*(1-pt(abs(t.obs.fastfood.model), df = 38))
#calculate the CI of fastfood.model
confint(gender.model)
```

Even though gender seems to have no association with fastfood consumption, 
it is represented here for explanatory purposes only: the fourth linear model for LDL, 
age and fast-food, gender. Dummy variables were used to convert gender to a quantitative variable.

```{r}
# MODEL 4 TO FIT IN REGRESSION: LDL ~ diet + gender + age 
diet_gender_age.interaction.model <- lm(LDL ~ fastfoodrarely * fastfoodoften * genderman * genderwoman * age, data = LDL_survey)
# beta
summary(diet_gender_age.interaction.model)
# t-value and pvalue
t.obs.diet_gender_age.model <- -16.6374/15.8454
t.obs.diet_gender_age.model #-1.049983
# 2 tails p-value
2*(1-pt(abs(t.obs.diet_gender_age.model), df = 32))
# calculate the CI of fastfood.model
confint(diet_gender_age.interaction.model)
```

**For the model assumption, we're representing the best model which is the one of LSL and fastfood consumption and age.** 
It was assumed the data had no error in measurement.

Residual plots were tested to see if the model met the assumptions of linearity, 
normality of the error term (using the normal Q-Q plot of residuals) and homoskedasticity. 
The normal QQ-plot of the residuals of the LDL reveals systematic deviations from the straight line. 
There is a small number of outliers (3 compared to the sample size of 40), however, the normality would be improved if we increase the sample size.

```{r}
# MODEL ASSUMPTION: LDL ~ diet + age 
age_diet.model <- lm(LDL ~ age + fastfoodoften + fastfoodrarely, data = LDL_survey )
```

```{r}
summary(age_diet.model)
age_diet.residuals <- residuals(age_diet.model)
Yhat_age_diet <- predict(age_diet.model)
```

The below plots show that residuals follow the normal distribution.

```{r}
# QQ plot 1 age and diet residuals
ggplot(LDL_survey, aes(sample = age_diet.residuals)) + 
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line(col = "red") + 
  labs(x = "Theoretical Residuals", y = "Sample Residuals") + 
  ggtitle("QQ Plot: Age and Diet Residuals")
```

```{r}
# density plot for ldl, age, and diet residuals 
plot(density(age_diet.residuals)) 
```

Below shows a plot for the fitted values vs the residuals, which can indicate if there is homoskedasticity in the model. 
The plot shows that there is somewhat of an increase in spread of fitted values vs residuals and the spread isn't complete constant.

```{r}
# Plot of fitted values vs residuals. 
age_diet.model <- lm(LDL ~ age + fastfoodoften + fastfoodrarely, data = LDL_survey )
plot(age_diet.model)
```

```{r}
# test interaction age - diet
two.way.interaction.model <- lm(LDL ~ age + fastfoodrarely + fastfoodoften +
                 age * fastfoodoften +
                 age * fastfoodrarely,
                 data = LDL_survey)
summary(two.way.interaction.model)
#interaction analysis
coef(two.way.interaction.model)
#Confidence intervals
confint(two.way.interaction.model)
#QQ plot of two way interaction model's residuals (age* fastfood)
two_way_interaction.residuals <- residuals(two.way.interaction.model)
Yhat_two_way_interaction <- predict(two.way.interaction.model)
ggplot(LDL_survey, aes(sample = two_way_interaction.residuals)) +
 stat_qq() +
 stat_qq_line(col = "red") +
 labs(x = "Theoretical Residuals", y = "Sample Residuals") +
 ggtitle("QQ Plot: Two Way Interaction Residuals")
```

The above explanatory data analysis demonstrates that for the response variable LDL levels, 
in those who respectively reported consuming a fastfood diet of 'often' or 'rarely', 
illustrated that for the two blocking variables of age and gender, gender was not a significant variable. 
The best model recommended here would be between LDL and age, fastfood.

# II. DISCUSSION (for other researchers)

Several factors are known to contribute to increased LDL levels. 
Previous studies have confirmed the association between frequent fast food 
consumption with increased LDL cholesterol [1,6]. Gender differences have also 
been found to exist between LDL cholesterol concentrations and subsequent mortality 
from coronary heart disease [2]. Moreover, it is important to note that LDL cholesterol 
also increases with normal aging in humans [3-6]. 

The majority of subjects were men with a higher mean age compared to women (47 vs 44 years). 
The age range of the group was between 20 and 72 years old. Men ate fast food more often 
compared to women, although this association was not significant (p=0.056). 
Those who ate fast food often also tended to be younger (Table 1) and had lower mean 
LDL levels than those who rarely ate fast food. Interestingly, the mean LDL levels 
for the whole sample were higher than the recommended level of <100mg/100ml (Table 2).

Woman | 18 (45) | 120.6 (12.6)
Man | 22 (55) | 123.6 (12.2)
All | 40 (100) | 122.2 (12.3)


Simple regression analysis

The analysis (from model LDL ~ diet) suggests that subjects who rarely consume fast food will have an increased LDL level of 3.2 mg/100ml. However, this was found to be not significant (p = 0.415) with a low R-squared value of 0.018. That is, fast food consumption alone is not a good predictor of LDL levels. xx Similarly, a simple regression analysis of LDL ~ gender was also found to be not significant (p = 0.44) with an R-squared value of 0.0158.However, the data does suggest that women have lower LDL levels than men. 

On the contrary, the regression model analysis between LDL and age found a significant relationship (p = 0.00002 or <0.001). For every year increase in age, LDL is estimated to increase by 0.48 mg/100ml. This linear relationship explains about 38% of the variance of LDL blood levels.

Multiple regression analysis

Gender was not found to be a significant predictor of LDL levels in our bivariate analysis. However, we explored the predictive power of age, gender and diet on LDL levels. In this model, none of the independent variables were significant (R-squared 0.5049, p = 0.0011).   

Our second multiple linear regression model including age and diet to estimate the LDL level was able to explain 45% the variance of LDL blood levels. Both age and diet showed significant linear relationships with LDL levels (p = 0.000003 and p = 0.03, respectively). At the 5% level of significance, if age increases with 1 unit then LDL is estimated to increase by 0.62 mg/100ml. At the same time, if the subject is often consuming fast food, LDL is estimated to increase by 7.84 mg/100ml. In this model, age and diet are able to uniquely predict the variance of LDL levels after controlling for their relationship with each other. This is the model that we would recommend.

**Only 45% of the variance of LDL blood levels was able to be explained by age and fastfood consumption diet. LDL levels were significantly associated with age and a diet that often includes fast food.** Previous studies suggested that there are other factors which affect the LDL blood levels, such as dietary cholesterol intake, other dietary and lifestyle factors [7] as well as the BMI in lean individuals [8]. The study’s small sample size, lack of information regarding the selection of the 40 subjects and limited information on the participants could be potential sources of bias. Other factors which affect LDL levels were not able to be included in the analyses, e.g. overweight/obesity, exercise levels, smoking, medications, diabetes [7,8]. Future research should include a larger sample size, more information on the baseline characteristics of subjects and a more detailed diet questionnaire.
